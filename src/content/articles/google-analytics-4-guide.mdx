## Common Mistakes to Avoid (and How to Fix Them)

Even with a powerful tool like Google Analytics 4 (GA4), it's easy to make missteps. Here are a few common ones and how to avoid them:

*   **Not Setting Up Conversions:** If you don't tell Google Analytics 4 (GA4) what success looks like (e.g., a purchase, a lead), you won't know if your website is actually helping your business grow. Always define your key business goals as conversions.
*   **Ignoring Mobile Data:** Mobile users often behave differently than desktop users. Always analyze mobile data separately to understand their unique journey and optimize their experience.
*   **Focusing Only on Traffic:** While traffic is important, it's not the full picture. Look beyond just how many people visit your site and focus on what they *do* (engagement) and if they complete your desired actions (conversions).
*   **Not Checking Regularly:** Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool. Make it a habit to check your reports regularly to spot trends, identify issues, and find new opportunities.
