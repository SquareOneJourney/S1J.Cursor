## Understanding the Data

### Search Volume

Search volume shows how many times a keyword is searched per month on average. This helps you understand:
- **High-volume keywords**: Lots of searches but high competition
- **Medium-volume keywords**: Good balance of searches and competition
- **Long-tail keywords**: Lower volume but often easier to rank for

### Competition Levels

Google shows three competition levels:
- **Low**: Easier to rank for, but may have lower search volume
- **Medium**: Balanced opportunity
- **High**: Very competitive, harder to rank for

### Bid Ranges

For advertisers, this shows suggested bid ranges. For content creators, it indicates how valuable the keyword is to businesses.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Focusing Only on High-Volume Keywords

High-volume keywords are often very competitive. Consider the balance between search volume and competition.

### 2. Ignoring Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords (3+ words) often have:
- Lower competition
- Higher conversion rates
- More specific intent

### 3. Not Considering User Intent

Ask yourself: What is the user trying to accomplish when they search for this keyword?
