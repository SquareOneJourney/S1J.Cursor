## Understanding the Data

| Metric | What It Means | How to Use It |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Average Monthly Searches** | The average number of searches per month for that keyword | Gauge audience size — 1,000+ = mainstream; 100–500 = niche but valuable |
| **Competition** | How many advertisers are bidding on this keyword | "Low" = easier to rank organically; "High" = popular or profitable keyword worth competing for |
| **Top of Page Bid (Cost Per Click (CPC))** | Estimated cost per click in paid search ads | High Cost Per Click (CPC) often means strong buyer intent or valuable leads |
| **Search Trends Graph** | Shows how demand changes month-to-month | Compare with Google Trends to confirm seasonality and spikes |

## Step-by-Step Example: “Car Wash” in Portland

**Search Results Might Include:**

| Keyword | Avg. Monthly Searches | Competition | Top of Page Bid (Cost Per Click (CPC)) |
|---------|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| car wash portland | 8,000 | Medium | $2.10 |
| mobile car detailing portland | 1,200 | Low | $3.40 |
| eco car wash portland | 250 | Low | $1.60 |

**Interpretation:**  
- “Car wash” → broad, high-volume demand — good anchor keyword.  
- “Mobile car detailing” → smaller audience but higher Cost Per Click (CPC) → likely higher-spending customers.  
- “Eco car wash” → emerging niche; low volume now, but a good long-term bet.

**Action Steps:**  
- Use **car wash portland** for your homepage and main Search Engine Optimization (SEO) target.  
- Build **service pages** for mobile and eco variations.  
- Test mobile car detailing as an ad group — Cost Per Click (CPC) suggests strong lead value.

## Finding Ideas You Might Miss

Keyword Planner’s **Keyword Ideas** section shows related searches that include your base term. Look for:

- **Service variants**: self-service car wash, hand wash, express wash  
- **Customer intent phrases**: best car wash near me, cheap car wash portland, touchless car wash  
- **Problem-based searches**: how to remove tree sap, wash car after winter salt  

These are great for **blog posts**, **landing pages**, and **ad copy**.

**Tip:** Sort by **Top of Page Bid (Cost Per Click (CPC))** to spot high-value keywords — even low-volume phrases can deliver profitable leads.

## Combine with Google Trends

- **Google Trends** → shows when interest rises.  
- **Keyword Planner** → shows how many people search and competition levels.  

Together, they answer:  
*Is demand big enough, steady enough, and profitable enough to pursue?*

Example:  
- If Trends shows “eco car wash” is rising steadily, and Keyword Planner shows moderate volume with low competition → emerging opportunity worth building content and early ads around.

## Turning Data Into Strategy

### 1. Build Your Keyword Map
Group keywords into logical clusters for your site:

- **Home / Core:** car wash portland, car wash near me  
- **Services:** mobile car wash, eco car wash, self-service car wash  
- **Support Content:** best time to wash car, touchless vs soft touch, how to detail car at home  

### 2. Prioritize by Demand + Competition
Simple scoring system:  
*(Monthly Searches × Intent Value) ÷ Competition*  

Helps you rank which topics to focus on first.

### 3. Plan Ads Intelligently
- 1 campaign per service type  
- 3–5 ads per campaign  
- Use exact keyword phrasing that wins in the data  
- Pause or adjust any term with high cost but low conversions

---

## Advanced Tips

- **Get search volume and forecasts** if you already have a keyword list — predicts traffic and cost if you ran ads.  
- **Compare cities:** duplicate searches for Portland → Seattle → Sacramento to spot expansion opportunities.  
- **Check indexed competition (0–100)** for more precise analysis.  
- **Add negative keywords**: remove irrelevant terms like songs, franchise, or equipment if you’re a service.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Confusing **Competition** (ad competition) with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) difficulty — they’re related but not identical.  
- Using global data for local decisions — always filter to your real service area.  
- Ignoring **Cost Per Click (CPC)** — high CPC often indicates high-value leads.  
- Forgetting to filter **Language and Device** if your audience is specific.

## Optional AI Assist

After exporting your keywords, you can ask AI tools to help:

- “Group these 50 keywords by intent (service, question, product) and output as a site map.”  
- “Identify 10 high-intent keywords for car-wash services in Portland with low competition.”  
- “Draft a 3-month SEO (Search Engine Optimization) plan using these keyword clusters.”  
- “Write Google Ads headlines using top-volume keywords and matching tone.”

AI **summarizes and organizes**, but your local knowledge gives it real value.
