Browsers like Chrome and Edge have been our window to the web.  
It’s not a choice — it’s an ingrained truth.

**Welcome to the future.**

**Comet — the first AI-powered web browser.**  
It doesn’t just show you pages; it searches them, summarizes them, and helps you act on what matters.

This isn’t browsing as we know it.  
It’s a complete redefinition of how we use the web — faster, smarter, and built to work with you, not against you.

If Chrome was built to search, **Comet was built to act.**

Can’t find what you’re looking for on a website?  
Comet lives inside your browser — ask it to find what you need, and it’s done.

About to check out online and wish you had a discount code?  
Tell Comet to find one — done.

No need to leave the page or open a new tab to ask Google or ChatGPT for help.  
**This is your one-stop workspace for the web.**

## What Makes Comet Different

Comet looks and feels like a modern browser — but it’s powered by AI that assists your every need.  
And I mean it when I say: once you start using it, you’ll never go back.

Here’s what it does differently:

- **Agentic Search:** Enter what you need, and watch it surf the web for you.
- **Summarizes pages instantly:** Open a long article, and Comet pulls out the key points for you — no extra clicks or Chrome extensions required.  
- **Organizes research automatically:** Save links, create topic folders, and group tabs by project without leaving the page.  
- **Acts on information:** Need to compare suppliers, draft an email, or plan your week? Comet’s built-in assistant can handle those tasks right where you’re browsing.  
- **Keeps context:** Unlike most browsers, Comet *remembers* what you were doing — so when you return, you pick up exactly where you left off.

## Why Small Business Owners Should Care

Running a business means juggling fifty tabs in your head and your browser.  
Comet won’t fix your workload — but it will make it *smarter.*

Imagine this:
- You’re researching new POS systems. Instead of ten open tabs, Comet gives you one summary comparing features and costs.  
- You’re planning a Facebook ad campaign. Comet can pull examples, draft headlines, and save everything neatly under “Ad Ideas.”  
- You’re managing suppliers or client lists. Comet can cross-reference data and even generate quick summaries for meetings.

This isn’t just convenience — it’s time reclaimed.

## The Real Innovation: Attention

Most tech tools chase productivity.  
Comet quietly protects your *attention.*

It cuts through the daily digital noise — summarizing what matters, storing what you’ll need later, and ignoring the rest.  
It’s the difference between browsing the web and actually *using* it.

And if you’ve ever felt like your computer was working *against* you — Comet is what it looks like when it finally starts helping.
