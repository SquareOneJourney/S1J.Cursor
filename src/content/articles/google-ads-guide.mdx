2. Click **New Campaign → Create without goals’ guidance** for full control.  
3. Choose **Search** as your campaign type — it targets users actively looking for your services.

5. Choose a **daily budget** — starting small ($10–$20/day) is perfectly fine.  
6. Select a **bidding strategy** such as **Maximize Clicks** or **Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)** to gather early performance data.  
7. Create **Ad Groups** around focused keyword themes (for example, “eco car wash,” “mobile detailing”).

## Understanding Key Google Ads Metrics

Behind every click is a story. These are the core numbers that tell it:

| Metric | What It Means | How to Use It |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Impressions** | Number of times your ad was shown | Low impressions often signal narrow targeting or low bids |
| **Clicks** | Number of people who clicked your ad | Indicates engagement — quality matters more than quantity |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | Percentage of impressions that became clicks | CTR above 3% is solid for most local businesses |
| **Cost Per Click (CPC)** | How much you pay for each click | Typical $1–$3 for local services; higher for legal, healthcare, finance |
| **Conversion Rate (CR)** | Percentage of clicks that become a lead or sale | The real success metric — aim 5–10% for local lead gen |
| **Quality Score** | Google’s 1–10 rating of ad + landing page relevance | Higher scores lower your costs and boost placement |

These metrics work together: impressions show reach, CTR shows interest, and CR shows profitability.

## Smart Account Structure = Lower Costs

Think of your Google Ads account like a miniature website:

- **Campaigns** represent your main business goals (for example, “Car Wash Services,” “Detailing Specials”).  
- **Ad Groups** organize related themes (“Eco Car Wash,” “Mobile Detailing”).  
- **Ads** are the words users see — your headlines and descriptions.  
- **Keywords** are the search terms that trigger those ads.  

Keeping your structure tidy helps Google understand your intent, which often reduces your Cost Per Click (CPC).  

> 💡 Pro Tip: Limit each Ad Group to 3–5 closely related keywords. Too many can dilute performance and waste budget.

## Writing Ads That Actually Convert

A well-crafted Google Ad is like a mini-sales pitch in 90 characters. Use this proven formula:

**Headline 1:** Your main keyword + location  
→ “Mobile Car Detailing in Portland”  

**Headline 2:** Your unique value proposition  
→ “Eco-Friendly Wash That Comes to You”  

**Description:** Benefits + clear call-to-action  
→ “Save time and water. Book a mobile detail in under 60 seconds. Get 10% off your first wash.”  

Always link to a **relevant landing page**, not just your homepage — the user should see exactly what was promised in the ad.

---

## Landing Page Must-Haves

The landing page is where curiosity turns into conversion. To keep visitors moving forward:

- Use a **matching headline** that repeats your ad’s main promise.  
- Present a **clear offer** — “Get a Free Quote,” “Book Now,” or “Call Today.”  
- Keep a visible **call-to-action button above the fold**.  
- Ensure **fast load speed (< 3 seconds)** and a **mobile-friendly layout**.  

> Even a 1-second delay can reduce conversion rate by 20%.

## Budgeting and Bidding Wisely

There’s no one-size-fits-all budget — it depends on your goals and local competition.  
Start with a test phase and choose a strategy that matches your learning curve.

| Strategy | When to Use | Goal |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Maximize Clicks** | Early testing | Gather data quickly |
| **Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)** | You want precise control | Focus on profitable traffic |
| **Maximize Conversions** | After collecting several weeks of data | Let Google optimize for results automatically |

> 💡 Rule of Thumb: Allow each keyword 20–30 clicks before deciding if it works. Testing beats guessing.

## The Optimization Loop: Your Weekly Routine

Treat Google Ads like a living system — small consistent tweaks beat big overhauls.

Each week:
1. Review the **Search Terms Report** and add irrelevant queries as **negative keywords**.  
2. Pause ads with **low CTR** or **high CPC** that produce no conversions.  
3. Duplicate your top performers and **A/B test** new headlines or calls-to-action.  
4. Verify **conversion tracking** in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) so every lead counts.  
5. Adjust bids — increase for strong performers, trim weak ones.

In just a few minutes a week, your campaigns will steadily sharpen and your cost-per-lead will drop.

## Connecting Google Ads to the Google Ecosystem

Google Ads becomes far more powerful when combined with other tools:  

- **Google Trends** → Discover what topics are rising in popularity.  
- **Google Keyword Planner** → Measure search volume and Cost Per Click (CPC).  
- **Google Ads** → Capture that demand with targeted campaigns.  
- **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** → Understand what visitors do after clicking.  
- **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** → Track conversions, phone calls, and form events.  
- **Google Business Profile (GBP)** → Show ads alongside maps, hours, and reviews.

Together, these tools form a closed feedback loop — from **search behavior → ad click → conversion → real-world sale**.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Everyone makes early missteps. Avoid these to save money and sanity:

- Launching with **broad-match keywords** — start with **phrase or exact match** to stay relevant.  
- Sending traffic to your **homepage** instead of a focused landing page.  
- Ignoring **mobile optimization** — over 70% of local searches happen on phones.  
- Forgetting **location filters** — never pay for clicks outside your service area.  
- Turning campaigns off too early — Google’s learning algorithm needs 7–10 days to stabilize.

Patience and precision are the twin engines of success in Google Ads.
