## Why Google Ads Matter

Google Ads allows you to appear at the top of search results for keywords relevant to your business. Unlike SEO, which takes time to show results, Google Ads can drive traffic immediately.

## Keyword Strategy

### Choosing the Right Keywords

Focus on keywords that:
- **Match your business**: Directly related to what you offer
- **Have commercial intent**: People looking to buy or hire
- **Are specific enough**: Not too broad or too narrow
- **Have reasonable competition**: Not impossible to compete for

### Match Types

Google offers different match types:
- **Exact match**: [plumber near me] - Only shows for this exact phrase
- **Phrase match**: "emergency plumber" - Shows for searches containing this phrase
- **Broad match**: plumber - Shows for related searches (use carefully)

## Writing Effective Ads

### Ad Components

Your ads consist of:
- **Headlines**: Up to 3 headlines (30 characters each)
- **Descriptions**: Up to 2 descriptions (90 characters each)
- **Display URL**: What people see (can be different from actual URL)
- **Final URL**: Where people actually go

### Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Mention what makes you different
- **Include keywords**: Use the keyword you're targeting
- **Create urgency**: "Limited time offer" or "Call today"
- **Include a call-to-action**: "Call now," "Get quote," "Shop today"

## Budget and Bidding

### Setting Your Budget

Start with a daily budget you're comfortable with. Google will spend up to 2x your daily budget on high-traffic days, but won't exceed your monthly budget.

### Bidding Strategies

- **Manual CPC**: You set the bid for each keyword
- **Target CPA**: Google optimizes for a specific cost per acquisition
- **Maximize conversions**: Google spends your budget to get the most conversions

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

Track these important metrics:
- **Impressions**: How many times your ad was shown
- **Clicks**: How many times people clicked your ad
- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Clicks divided by impressions
- **Cost per click (CPC)**: How much you pay for each click
- **Conversions**: Actions you want people to take
- **Cost per conversion**: How much you pay for each conversion

### Conversion Tracking

Set up conversion tracking to measure:
- **Phone calls**: From your website or ads
- **Form submissions**: Contact forms or quote requests
- **Online purchases**: E-commerce transactions
- **App downloads**: If you have a mobile app

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Bidding Too High Too Soon

Start with lower bids and increase gradually as you learn what works.

### 2. Using Broad Match Without Negative Keywords

Add negative keywords to prevent your ads from showing for irrelevant searches.

### 3. Ignoring Mobile Users

Make sure your ads and landing pages work well on mobile devices.

### 4. Not Testing Different Ad Variations

Create multiple ad variations to see what performs best.
