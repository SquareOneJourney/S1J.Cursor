If Google Trends shows what’s rising and Google Keyword Planner shows how big and valuable the demand is, **Google Ads** is how you capture it. It’s not just running ads — it’s matching intent, spending smartly, and measuring what matters.  

Whether you’re a small service business or testing a new idea, Google Ads gives you the most direct route from **someone searching** → **someone buying**.

## Understanding Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | How to Use It |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Impressions** | How many times your ad was shown | Indicates visibility and reach. Low impressions = narrow targeting or low bids |
| **Clicks** | How many people clicked your ad | Direct engagement — focus on quality, not just volume |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | Percentage of people who clicked after seeing your ad | CTR above 3% is strong for most local businesses |
| **Cost Per Click (CPC)** | How much you pay per click | Benchmark $1–$3 for local services; more for legal, healthcare, finance |
| **Conversion Rate** | Percentage of clicks that become a lead or sale | The real measure of success — aim for 5–10% for local lead generation |
| **Quality Score** | Google’s 1–10 rating of ad + landing page | Higher scores = lower costs and better placement; keep relevance high |

## Smart Account Structure = Lower Costs

Think of your account like a mini website:

- **Campaigns** = Major goals (e.g., “Car Wash Services,” “Detailing Specials”)  
- **Ad Groups** = Specific themes (e.g., “Eco Car Wash,” “Mobile Car Detailing”)  
- **Ads** = The words people see (headlines + descriptions)  
- **Keywords** = The searches that trigger your ads  

**Pro Tip:** Keep 3–5 keywords per Ad Group. Too many = scattered results.

## Writing Ads That Convert

**Formula for effective ads:**

- **Headline 1**: Primary keyword + location  
  e.g., “Mobile Car Detailing in Portland”  
- **Headline 2**: Value proposition or differentiator  
  e.g., “Eco-Friendly Wash That Comes to You”  
- **Description**: Benefits + clear call-to-action  
  e.g., “Save time and water. Book a mobile detail in under 60 seconds. Get 10% off your first wash.”  
- **Final URL**: Relevant, fast-loading landing page (not just your homepage)  

---

## Landing Page Must-Haves

- Matching headline: Same phrasing as your ad  
- Clear offer: Free quote, call now, or booking form  
- Contact button above the fold  
- Fast load speed (\<3 seconds)  
- Mobile-friendly design  

> Even a 1-second delay can drop conversion rate by 20%.

## Budgeting & Bidding Wisely

| Strategy | When to Use | Goal |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Maximize Clicks** | When collecting data | Fast traffic for keyword testing |
| **Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)** | When you want full control | Focus on profitable clicks |
| **Maximize Conversions** | After a few weeks of data | Let Google optimize based on what’s converting |

**Rule of Thumb:** Spend enough to get 20–30 clicks per keyword before judging results.

## Optimization Loop: Weekly Routine

- Check **Search Terms Report** → add irrelevant searches as negative keywords  
- Pause poor performers: Low CTR or high Cost Per Click (CPC) with no conversions  
- Duplicate winning ads → test headline variations or calls-to-action  
- Check **conversion tracking** → ensure leads or form submissions are counted  
- Adjust bids: Increase for high converters, reduce for low  

**Consistency beats volume:** Small weekly tweaks = exponential long-term improvement.
