## Mobile Usability

### Why Mobile Matters

More than half of all web traffic comes from mobile devices. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it primarily uses the mobile version of your site for ranking.

### Common Mobile Issues

- **Text too small to read**: Users have to zoom to read content
- **Clickable elements too close**: Buttons or links are too close together
- **Content wider than screen**: Horizontal scrolling required
- **Viewport not configured**: Page doesn't adapt to mobile screens

- **Regular backups**: Keep copies of your website files
- **Monitor regularly**: Check GSC for security alerts

## Core Web Vitals

### What are Core Web Vitals?

Google's Core Web Vitals measure user experience:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: How fast the main content loads
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: How quickly the page responds to user interaction
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: How much the page layout shifts during loading

### Improving Core Web Vitals
