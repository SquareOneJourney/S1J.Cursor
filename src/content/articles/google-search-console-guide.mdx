Data is only as powerful as your ability to **capture and act on it**.  
That’s where **Google Search Console (GSC)** comes in — your free tool for understanding how your website performs in Google Search and how users find you.  

Instead of guessing which keywords work or which pages need attention, Google Search Console (GSC) gives you **direct insight from Google itself**.

## What Google Search Console (GSC) Actually Does

Think of Google Search Console (GSC) as your **website’s health dashboard** in Google Search. It shows you:  

- What search queries bring users to your site  
- Which pages rank highest — and which are invisible  
- How often users click your results (**Click-Through Rate (CTR)**)  
- Whether Google can crawl or index your pages  
- If your site works well on mobile  

| Without Google Search Console (GSC) | With Google Search Console (GSC) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Guess which keywords drive traffic | See exact search queries driving traffic |
| Unaware of indexing issues | Identify pages not indexed or blocked |
| Hard to measure mobile performance | Track mobile usability issues |
| Manual SEO tracking | Automated insights directly from Google |

> 💡 Google Search Console (GSC) is your **truth layer** — it tells you what’s working, what’s broken, and what needs improvement.
