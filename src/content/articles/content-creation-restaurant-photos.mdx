# AI Cheat Codes for Restaurant Photos
### Three quick prompts to make your food, your space, and your online menu look how they should.

Running a restaurant means doing everything — payroll, prep, staff schedules, and yes, photos.  
You probably take them yourself. Between orders, before service, or after close.  

AI isn’t here to replace photographers.  
It’s just a small shortcut — a way to make your photos match what your guests actually see when they walk in.

Here are three simple image prompts that save time and make a real difference.

## 1. Online Ordering — Clear, Clean, True to Life

The hardest part of online menus is lighting. 
Food often looks darker, flatter, or more yellow than it does in person.  
One quick prompt can clean that up without changing the meal.

<PromptBox text="Transform this product photo into a high-quality, studio-style image. Use soft, balanced lighting, remove any background distractions, apply subtle color correction, and give it a clean, modern look suitable for an e-commerce catalog. Replace the background with a white marble surface to add elegance and contrast, while keeping the product’s shape, texture, and colors true to life." />

<figure className="my-8 mx-auto max-w-6x2">
  <img
    src="/Hash Image.png"
    alt="Before and after restaurant hash"
    className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200"
  />
  <figcaption className="mt-2 text-center text-xs text-gray-500">
    Before and after
  </figcaption>
</figure>

That’s it. Run that once before uploading your delivery photos and you’ll see the difference right away — no extra filters, no reshoot.

## 2. The Promo Dish — Quick Fix for Instagram or Email

You made something great for the weekend special. You snap a photo before it leaves the pass, but the lighting isn’t right.  
AI can help fix that in seconds — no heavy editing needed.

<PromptBox text="Add soft studio-style lighting to highlight the dish naturally. Adjust warmth and contrast for an even, realistic tone. Keep the background slightly blurred but natural." />

It’s still your photo. Still your food.  
Just balanced the way it should have looked when you first plated it.
