Corporate morality has become a costume. Companies talk about “ethics” the way politicians talk about “hope” — as branding, not belief. When a firm says it’s safeguarding truth, protecting users, or preserving our planet, it isn’t appealing to conscience; it’s calculating liability. The moral language is theater — a way to sound principled while doing exactly what any self-interested actor would do: guard its money and image. They don’t fear doing harm. They fear *being caught.*


Inside company walls, hypocrisy isn’t a flaw of the system — it is the system. Employees are given a kind of corporate anesthesia to keep their moral nerves from firing: vision statements, “responsible innovation” decks, and quarterly values updates. Deep down, most workers know that beneath the HR slogans, the work they produce serves a machine indifferent to the ideals their employer professes. But companies make it easier to ignore that fact than to confront it. Complicity becomes a form of professional hygiene — stay clean enough to keep your job, not so clean that you make anyone uncomfortable.


It’s understandable that employees resign themselves to this. Institutions reward comfort and punish friction. The moral language may be empty, but it feels efficient and soothing while it quietly builds cohesion and culls dissent. The longer you stay, the more natural the distortion feels. What once looked like compromise becomes practicality. Eventually you stop asking whether something is right — only whether it’s “within policy.”

Scaled up, this distortion becomes a corrosive cultural feedback loop. Every layer of society — from relationships to political movements — learns to talk like a PR team: earnest, self-exonerating, and perfectly inoffensive. As rational and ethical thought yield to the pursuit of smooth cohesion behind non-human agendas — metrics, markets, algorithms — the reek of moral decay is rebranded as the perfume of progress. We project performative “ethics” like a hologram over whatever mess we refuse to clean up, telling ourselves the system works because the slogans still sound good.


That may be the real danger. The problem isn’t our motives but our fading reflex to care about the larger whole. When everyone moralizes for the sake of convenience, anything can be justified as long as it’s well-worded. We are living in a world of rot — with an excellent PR team.


But we don’t need to concede to the corruption of commercial credos. The same technology that makes corporate deceit scalable also makes independence possible. Tools that once belonged only to institutions — publishing platforms, code, automation, design intelligence — now sit at your fingertips. The only remaining barrier to pursuing your own entrepreneurial endeavors is the courage to act. Building something you control is no longer just an economic choice — it’s a moral one. To work for yourself is, at last, to work for something real.
